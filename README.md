What is this project ?
----------------------

This project is **NOT** the official libtiff repository.

It is a mirror of libtiff sources hosted at https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff.

It is used as staging area to maintain topics specific to BrownBiomechanics projects like Autoscoper that will eventually be contributed back to the official repository.

What is the branch naming convention ?
--------------------------------------

Each branch is named following the pattern `brownbiomechanics[-vX.Y.Z]-YYYY-MM-DD-SHA{N}`

where:

* `brownbiomechanics` is the name of the custom application or extension.
* `vX.Y.Z` is the version of forked project
* `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date of the last official commit associated with the branch.
* `SHA{N}` are the first N characters of the last official commit associated with the branch.
